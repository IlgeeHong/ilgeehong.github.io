## About Me

Hello! I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Machine Learning at Georgia Institute of Technology, where I am advised by [Prof. Tuo Zhao](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~tzhao80/). Before attending GT, I received my M.S. degree in Statistics from the University of Chicago in 2023, where I was advised by [Prof. Claire Donnat](https://donnate.github.io/) and [Prof. Mladen Kolar](https://mkolar.coffeejunkies.org/). Prior to UChicago, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Statistics at Yonsei University. At Yonsei, I was advised by [Prof. Sangun Park](https://yonsei.pure.elsevier.com/en/persons/sangun-park).

## Research Interests

My research primarily focuses on post-training methods for LLMs. In particular, I develop training and inference frameworks to improve their capabilities in reasoning, instruction following, and multi-agent collaboration, especially through reinforcement learning.

My research focuses on post-training methods for large language models (LLMs). Specifically, I am developing methodologies to improve instruction following, reasoning, and coding abilities by:

1. training LLMs with reinforcement learning (RL), and
2. reducing reliance on costly supervision and data.
